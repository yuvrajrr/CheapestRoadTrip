# CheapestRoadTrip
This program identifies the cheapest path (in terms of meal prices) during a road trip between cities. <br/>

To run the program, run the Main.java file after you enter two cities into the main (where Boston and Minneapolis are currently listed). Utilize the connectedCities.txt file to identify which cities are connected and could be inputted.  <br/>

A file labeled out.txt will be created in the data folder once Main.java is run and it will display a BFS and DFS between the inputted cities, as well as the cheapest path. <br/>

The cheapest path is identified through the meal prices that are available in the data folder.
